# codingsols

## Introduction

codingsols is a coding forum designed to connect programmers of all levels, from beginners to experts.  It provides a platform for asking and answering questions, sharing knowledge, and collaborating on coding projects.  The goal is to foster a supportive and inclusive community where everyone can learn and grow.

## Installation

These instructions assume you have a basic understanding of how to use Git and a web server.  The specifics of installation will depend on the technology stack used to build codingsols.  This example assumes a Node.js/Express.js based backend and a React frontend (replace with your actual tech stack):


1. **Clone the repository:**

git clone <repository_url>
   
2. **Navigate to the directory:**

   cd codingsols
   
4. **Install dependencies (Backend):**

   cd backend
   npm install
   
5. **Install dependencies (Frontend):**

   cd ../frontend
   npm install

6. **Start the backend server:**

   cd ../backend
   npm start


7. **Start the frontend development server:**

   cd ../frontend
   npm start


   You should now be able to access codingsols at `http://localhost:3000` (or a similar address depending on your configuration).
